# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create an initial responsive, multi-page youth organization frontend with a consistent theme, top navigation, and a Home hero section using generated images.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive multi-page frontend scaffold with top navigation and pages: Home, About, Programs, Events, Contact.
- Add distinct English placeholder content for each page and ensure client-side navigation (no full page reloads).
- Apply a consistent visual theme across all pages (excluding a blue/purple primary palette) with clear typography hierarchy.
- Implement a Home page hero section with an English headline/description and a generated hero image.
- Add generated static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and render at least the logo and hero image in the UI.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a mobile-friendly youth organization site with working navigation across the five pages, see a themed layout, and view a Home hero section and logo using bundled static images.
