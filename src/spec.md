# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the application to address the “Canister ID Not Resolved (Error 400)” issue shown in the provided screenshot.

**Planned changes:**
- Investigate and fix the app’s Internet Computer/ICP canister routing configuration so the deployed site resolves to a valid canister ID / recognized domain.
- Validate deployment settings to ensure end-users can load the app without the gateway error.

**User-visible outcome:** The application loads normally in the browser instead of showing the “Canister ID Not Resolved” error page.
