# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Continue general app updates while pausing any work related to custom domain (yfo.org) setup and Google Search Console verification.

**Planned changes:**
- Exclude any implementation or documentation changes related to connecting/configuring a custom domain (yfo.org).
- Exclude any implementation or documentation changes related to Google Search Console verification (meta tag, scripts, DNS TXT, or production promotion steps).
- Ensure any user-facing text in other app updates remains in English.

**User-visible outcome:** The app can continue to receive non-domain, non–Search Console related updates, with no changes to domain connection or Google Search Console verification flows.
