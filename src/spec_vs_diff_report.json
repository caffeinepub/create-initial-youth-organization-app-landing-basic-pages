  "summary": "Diff implements Home bottom-positioned primary navigation (via a Sheet + floating button), repurposes the mobile hamburger menu to Settings/Close/Logout with logout logic, adds a Settings Sheet with theme toggle + share-link copy UI, and updates Android APK documentation to reference the production PWA URL. Some acceptance-criteria details are not verifiable due to truncation (notably the full Install App behavior and Google Play distribution clarification text).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-44",
      "requirement": "Improve add-to-home-screen discoverability by adding an “Install app” entry point inside Settings that triggers the existing PWA install flow when available, and otherwise shows an English message guiding the user to use the browser’s “Add to Home screen” option.",
      "reason": "SettingsSheet includes an \"Install App\" section and uses `usePwaInstallPrompt`, but the relevant portion is truncated, so it is not possible to confirm that (1) it triggers the same install prompt behavior as `InstallPromptBanner`, and (2) it shows the required fallback guidance message when install is not supported.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-45",
      "requirement": "Update the existing Android APK documentation to clarify what is and is not supported regarding Google Play distribution (publishing requires separate developer account steps and is not performed automatically by the app).",
      "reason": "The doc update shows the production URL example, but the provided diff snippet is truncated before any explicit Google Play distribution clarification can be verified.",
