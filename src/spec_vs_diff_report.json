  "summary": "REQ-61 share link behavior appears implemented across Settings plus (per file summaries) TopNav mobile menu and Footer using a shared Web Share API + clipboard fallback utility with English feedback. REQ-62 adds backend APK URL getters/setters and Settings integration, plus an admin configuration page/route. Events are wired end-to-end (hooks, public Events page, admin manager), but backend Events schema and persistence do not meet REQ-63 minimum fields and stable storage requirements, and the public Events page does not render the required event \"type\" field.",
