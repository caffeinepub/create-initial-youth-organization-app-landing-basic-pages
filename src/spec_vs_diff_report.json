  "summary": "Diff implements branding/logo plumbing and a reusable admin MediaPicker, adds admin branding page and routes, updates TopNav to use backend branding logo with fallback, and extends history/about/home editors to include MediaPicker with backend model/migration changes. Two likely gaps: (1) fallback logo still hardcodes a specific filename, and (2) public rendering of video media is not evidenced and HistoryPage currently renders media only as an <img>.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-33",
      "requirement": "Fix the site-wide header logo so the same correct logo is shown consistently on all pages by removing any hardcoded/incorrect logo filename usage and using a single canonical logo source throughout the frontend; fallback to existing generated logo asset when no configured logo exists.",
      "reason": "While TopNav now uses a shared getLogoUrl() helper, the fallback in branding config is still a hardcoded, specific logo filename/path. This appears to violate the requirement to remove hardcoded/incorrect logo filename usage and to fall back to the existing generated logo asset.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-37",
      "requirement": "Public pages that render the edited content display the saved images/videos appropriately (read-only) for History, About, and Home content.",
      "reason": "HistoryPage renders attached media using an <img> tag only; there is no evidence of conditional rendering for video (e.g., <video>) when a video is selected via the 'Add picture or video' control. Diff evidence for About/Home public rendering of media is not shown, and for History it appears incomplete for video.",
