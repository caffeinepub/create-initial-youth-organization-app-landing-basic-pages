  "summary": "REQ-73 is only partially addressed: the diff adds/updates a production build script that runs the existing Google Search Console (GSC) meta-tag verification and writes a detailed log file, but there is no evidence the full production promotion/deployment flow was re-run or that the live site was updated. Additionally, substantial new/changed UI/pages/routes appear in the frontend that were not requested and conflict with the “no new UI/UX changes” non-goal/constraints.",

      "id": "REQ-73",
      "requirement": "Re-run the full production build and promotion/deployment flow again (same flow that previously failed), ensuring the existing Google Search Console meta-tag verification step blocks deployment if the tag is missing.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a build orchestrator and GSC verification script, but does not show any promotion/deployment execution (e.g., dfx deploy/promote steps, CI workflow changes, or deployment logs/artifacts) being run or wired into the deploy flow. It also does not show evidence that the deployment to the specified URL occurred.",

      "id": "REQ-73",
      "requirement": "If the build/deploy fails again, capture the exact failing step and full error output in build logs/artifacts.",
      "reason": "The script writes to a local file (production-build.log) and uses execSync with stdio: 'inherit', but the diff does not show CI/build pipeline artifact collection or deploy-step logging/artifact retention for the full build+deploy flow (especially for the deployment/promotion steps).",
