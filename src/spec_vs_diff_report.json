  "summary": "Diff adds a new production build orchestrator script and enhances the existing GSC meta verification script; it also updates the service worker cache strategy/versioning and adds/updates deployment documentation. However, the diff does not show actual production deployment changes, nor does it show the verification script being wired into the production build/deploy pipeline or the meta tag being added/confirmed in the source HTML.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-46",
      "requirement": "Deploy the latest application build (current latest version) to the production Internet Computer canisters so the public site is served at https://pd5nf-fqaaa-aaaan-qetaq-cai.icp0.io.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows scripts/docs/service-worker changes; it does not include any canister deployment configuration or automation changes (e.g., dfx deploy pipeline updates) that would evidence a production deployment of both frontend and backend to the specified canisters.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the deployed production HTML contains the Google Search Console verification meta tag in the rendered <head> on https://pd5nf-fqaaa-aaaan-qetaq-cai.icp0.io, and fail the build/deploy process if the meta tag is missing (using the existing build-time verification script).",
      "reason": "While the verification script exists/was modified and a new wrapper script was added, the diff does not show (1) the meta tag being present in the HTML source template (e.g., frontend/index.html) nor (2) any change that ensures the check runs as part of the actual production build/deploy pipeline (e.g., package.json scripts/CI config).",
