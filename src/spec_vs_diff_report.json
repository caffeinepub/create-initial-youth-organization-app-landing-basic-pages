  "summary": "Core multi-page scaffold with TanStack Router, shared layout (TopNav + Footer), and youth-oriented theme/typography is implemented. Home hero section references the requested generated hero image and the logo is referenced in nav/footer. However, the diff summary does not show the required generated image files under frontend/public/assets/generated, and some navigation links (in Footer) use plain anchors which likely cause full page reloads, conflicting with SPA navigation requirements. Several authentication/actor hooks and Internet Identity integration appear added but were not requested.",
